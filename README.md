Disease Prediction and Consultation is based on Disease Prediction system which is
use Machine learning to give the Disease it could give 42 types of Disease by getting
the symptoms by user input could find the types of Disease he/she have .The Machine
Learning Model have the accuracy of around 98% to 99% depend on training
data .Here we will get to know that if there is certain kind of disease that person can
suffer in future according to his/her current provided data of body.These prediction
can be done using different Machine Learning Algorithms.User will provide his data
using web application and at the backend all the Machine Learning Algorithms will
get run and show results in frontend.We will be using MERN Stack Technology for
building web application and Consultation chat. Here using MERN Stack we provide single page application which is very fast and
user friendly. User select the symptoms using frontend made by ReactJs and get the
result from backend where nodejs integrated with machine learning and send result to
the frontend. User can chat with doctorâ€™s and other uses using chat services also is
responsive so can be used in mobile as well. Here user select his symptoms and get
result of their disease accurately on screen. Here you can search for particular
symptoms and also for particular users to chat with them. All the user get sorted
according to latest message with particular user. Here whole chatting will happen in
real-time using Socket.io module of node.js and no need to refresh the application for
fetching new messages it will get auto fetch.
